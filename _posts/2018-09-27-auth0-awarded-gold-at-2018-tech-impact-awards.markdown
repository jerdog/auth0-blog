**BELLEVUE, Wash., September 27, 2018** – [Auth0](https://auth0.com/), a global leader in Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS), today announced it has been honored with Gold in the Security category for Seattle Business magazine’s 2018 Tech Impact Awards. 

The Tech Impact Awards recognize companies in Washington state that are using technology to have a significant impact on business, industry, or society. This year, 17 companies out of more than 100 entries were selected as finalists in categories including: Enterprise, Cloud, Security, Emerging Companies, Consumer/Retail, Analytics, Software-as-a-Service, Financial Technology, and Entertainment.

“Being recognized as a security company that is making an impact is very rewarding, and is an honor that makes us very proud,” said Eugenio Pace, CEO and Co-founder of Auth0. “Despite being a distributed company, we have strong roots in the Seattle area. We are dedicated and committed to continue growing here and making an impact on a global scale.” 

During a ceremony at MoPOP in Seattle on September 25th, the honorees were celebrated for their achievements in Washington’s tech sector. Honorees were chosen by a panel of judges from leading area companies, such as Ignition Partners, Madrona Venture Group, Techstars, Female Founders Alliance, and more.

“We are heartened by our region’s continued ability to lead the country in so many diverse tech sectors,” said Leslie Helm, executive editor of Seattle Business. “We present the Tech Impact Awards to recognize and encourage the innovation so important to our economy.”  

The Tech Impact Awards were presented by Seattle Business magazine with the support of presenting sponsor UnitedHealthcare and signature sponsor AristaPoint. Read more about the awards at [seattlebusinessmag.com](https://www.seattlebusinessmag.com/).
