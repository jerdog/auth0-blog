**BELLEVUE, Wash., September 25, 2018** – [Auth0](https://auth0.com/), a global leader in Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS), today announced the company’s growth in Australia, New Zealand, and neighboring countries. In the past year alone, Auth0 has tripled its staff in this region to support the 125 percent growth in customer acquisition, including well-known enterprises such as CarsGuide, Atlassian, AGL, Servcorp, THE ICONIC, Television New Zealand (TVNZ), and many others. 

A recent [industry report](https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/4837042/consumer-iam-market-by-solution-service-authentication-type-deployment-mode-organization-size-industry-vertical-and-region-global-forecast-to-2023.html) by Report Buyer forecasts the consumer Identity and Access Management (IAM) market to grow to more than $37 billion by 2023, with Asia Pacific accounting for the highest growth rate during this period. 

The rapid adoption of Auth0’s Universal Identity Platform, especially within Australia and New Zealand over the past year, is indicative of the company’s continued expansion throughout this region. 

"As one of the largest online car marketplaces in the country, one of our primary goals is to make things simpler, safer, and more enjoyable for our customers during their car-purchasing process,” said Jeremy Gupta, CTO of CarsGuide. “For us, that involves using best-of-breed platforms, enabling our internal teams to move with speed – and leaving security and user identity to the experts. We'll soon have two large consumer brands in market with the introduction of Autotrader, and Auth0’s seamless and secure login process will help immensely with providing users a superior experience, no matter the channel."

“Enterprises are choosing Auth0 for its extensibility and ability to simultaneously address the identity needs for any audience that needs authentication,” said Eugenio Pace, CEO and Co-founder of Auth0. “This demand is driving our remarkable growth across Australia and New Zealand, and we are continually adding to our team in Sydney.”

The threefold growth of the team, led by Regional Director Richard Marr, represents Auth0’s commitment to its customers in this region.

Pace adds, “I had the pleasure of being in Sydney two weeks ago to meet our valued customers and ensure we are providing them with the best identity solution now and into the future.” 

Funds from the company’s [$55M in Series D funding](https://auth0.com/blog/auth0-announces-55m-series-d-funding/), announced in May, have driven Auth0’s expansion in Australia and New Zealand as part of the company’s wider global growth strategy.
